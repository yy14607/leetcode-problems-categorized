7,https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi,8. String to Integer (atoi),Medium,"Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.
Note:
Example 1:
Input: ""42""
Output: 42
Example 2:
Input: ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.
Example 3:
Input: ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.
Example 4:
Input: ""words and 987""
Output: 0
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical 
             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.

37,https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say,38. Count and Say,Easy,"The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as ""one 1"" or 11.
11 is read off as ""two 1s"" or 21.
21 is read off as ""one 2, then one 1"" or 1211.
Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.
Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
 
Example 1:
Input: 1
Output: ""1""
Explanation: This is the base case.
Example 2:
Input: 4
Output: ""1211""
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was ""21"" in which we have two groups ""2"" and ""1"", ""2"" can be read as ""12"" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way ""1"" is read as ""11"", so the answer is the concatenation of ""12"" and ""11"" which is ""1211"".

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:

Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
Internally you can think of this:
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.

115,https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node,116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node,Medium,"You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 
Follow up:
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
 
Constraints:

117,https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle,118. Pascal's Triangle,Easy,"Given a non-negative integer numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
Example:
Input: 5
Output:
[

    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]

118,https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii,119. Pascal's Triangle II,Easy,"Given a non-negative index k where k ≤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.
Note that the row index starts from 0.
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
Example:
Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
Follow up:
Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?
"
119,https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle,120. Triangle,Medium,"Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.
For example, given the following triangle
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).
Note:
Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.

120,https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock,121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock,Easy,"Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
Example 1:
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
